# Contributing to the Icon Editor for LabVIEW

Contributions to the Icon Editor are being evaluated by LabVIEW R&D. They will follow a pull-request model and require a licence release that has not been finalized yet.

For now, everyone is welcome to create a branch, make changes, and submit a pull request. However, no pull request will be approved until the license release is available and filled out.
